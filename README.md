RACHEL Project Technical User's Guide

This is where the source material is maintained for the RACHEL Technical User's Guide. We publish the guide on leanpub.com where people can freely read and download the book.

You are welcome to fork the project, update the material and send pull requests so we can incorporate it and update the book.
