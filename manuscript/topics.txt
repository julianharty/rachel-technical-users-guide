# Suggested Topics
Here's the place to add any topics we'd like to suggest for this book.

20-May-2015: 
New topics asked at the workshop at elearning-africa
* Can the Android apps work on BlackBerry 10 devices? Potentially yes, they should, if the relevant API's are supported. However Kiwix uses a C++ library that might need some work to compile / port. And the small webserver used by Android RACHEL may not work either.
* How to communicate, digitally, in nomadic environments in North Sudan.
* RACHEL in Arabic?
